# bsi_matlab
Functions for computation of Baseline shift Index (BSI)

bsi_pipeline - is a pipeline for BSI computation

ssd_extended - Spatio-Spectral Decomposition with additional processing

power_ratio - takes in power spectral density and signal and noise band edges and computed power ratio

compute_bsi - computes baseline-shift index from amplitude envelope of oscillatory activity and corresponding low-frequency signal (baseline shifts)
